    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this challenge is to work with 'dirty data'. Most real data is dirty and the availability of high-quality, open-source ML and data analysis frameworks (such as [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/),\n",
    "[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)...) means that the next frontier for tooling and automation lies in preprocessing. This challenge aims to investigate methodologies to perform statistical analysis directly on the original dirty data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two datasets in this challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `company_revenue_TRAIN.csv` - company revenue declarations.\n",
    "* `award_notices_RAMP.csv` -  French Attribution Notices.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Aim\n",
    "\n",
    "The predictive aim of this challenge is to use `company_revenue_TRAIN.csv` and `award_notices_RAMP.csv` to predict the Revenue for each entry in the 'company financial data' dataset. It is advised that you use both datasets, as it improves the prediction (see [Score comparison](#Score-comparison)), but using only the `company_revenue_TRAIN.csv` dataset is also allowed."

    "\n",
    "## Company financial data\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was built from an extract of the [National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE)](https://www.insee.fr/en/accueil) reference database of company revenue declarations from 2013 to 2018. Each row represents the declaration of one company for one year and the following information is provided in the columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Legal_ID` - the reconcilled legal ID of the company\n",
    "* `Name` - the name of the company\n",
    "* `Activity_code (APE)` - 'Activite Principale de l'Entreprise', the main activity of the company - more information in [English](https://www.startbusinessinfrance.com/code-ape) or in [French](https://www.service-public.fr/professionnels-entreprises/vosdroits/F33050)\n",
    "* `Address` \n",

    "* `Fiscal_year_end_date`\n",
    "* `Fiscal_year_duration_in_months`\n",
    "* `Year`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few things to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "* there are revenue declarations for the same company but different years\n",
    "* there is a large reduction in entries for the years 2017 and 2018 due to the Loi Macron law in 2017\n",
    "* the 'same company' can have several different entities, resulting in entries where the `Legal_ID` is different but the `Name`, `Address`, `City` and `Zipcode` are all the same.\n",
    "* `Revenue` can be negative. A negative revenue may be due to cancelled orders from the previous fiscal year that was recorded in the current fiscal year.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Award notices\n",
    "\n",
    "Every French public organisation has to issue a call for tenders when buying supplies or services (above a minimum threshold). These are called public procurement contracts. Companies then compete anonymously on these contracts and when a bid is awarded, a notice has to be legally published by the public organization on the [BOAMP](https://www.boamp.fr/) (historical data is hosted by the [DILA](https://www.dila.premier-ministre.gouv.fr/)). These are called French Attribution Notices (FAN). About 25% of awards are actually electronically published.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each contract can be divided into a maximum of 5 lots and the same company can win >1 lot of a contract. The award notices dataset comprises award notices from 2017 and 2018. Each row refers to one lot and there can be up to 5 lots referring to the same contract. The following information is provided for each lot:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ID_call` - ID of the award notice\n",
    "* `Publication_date` of the award notice\n",
    "* `End_of_call_date` of the award notice\n",
    "* `Departments_of_publication` - the department code(s) of the award notice\n",
    "* `Department_of_provision` - the department code(s) where the contract works/goods/services were provided \n",
    "* `Call_summary` - summary of the award notice\n",
    "* `Call_title` - title of the award notice\n",
    "* `Complete_call_description` - description of the award notice\n",
    "* `Total_amount` - total amount of the contract, from all lots, in euros\n",
    "* `CPV_classes` - Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV), a classification system for public procurement used to describe the subject of procurement contracts (more information can be found [here](https://simap.ted.europa.eu/cpv))\n",
    "Columns providing details about the company issuing the contract:\n",
    "* `Buyer_name` \n",
    "* `Buyer_address`\n",
    "* `Buyer_zipcode`\n",
    "* `Buyer_city`\n",
    "* `Buyer_email`\n",
    "* `Buyer_URL`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Contract_awarded` - whether or not the contact was awarded\n",
    "\n",
    "Columns providing details about the winner of each lot:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ID` - unique lot ID \n",
    "* `awarded` - whether or not the contact was awarded\n",
    "* `description` - description of the lot\n",
    "* `incumbent_name` - name of the lot winnter\n",
    "* `incumbent_address` - address of the lot winner\n",
    "* `incumbent_zipcode` - zipcode of the lot winner\n",
    "* `incumbent_city` - city of the lot winner\n",
    "* `incumbent_country` - country of the lot winner\n",
    "* `number_of_received_bids` - number of bids this lot received\n",
    "* `amount` - amount of the lot in euros\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both data sets are very dirty. There is a lot of missing data and the column descriptions provided above are a guide only. Further, the award notices dataset is much smaller than the company revenue declarations dataset. Therefore, it is expected that many companies in the company revenue declarations dataset are not present in the award notices dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training and test\n",
    "\n",
    "The company revenue training dataset has been split into 'training' and 'test' subsets. The shapes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* training: (1 495 948, 11)\n",
    "* test: (520 966, 11)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your model will be tested on a completely separate company revenue dataset stored on the RAMP server. This dataset has a shape of (702 181, 11). This test dataset will also be dirty but we can guarantee that the following columns will (only) be of numerical data type:\n",
    "\n",

    "## Submitting to [ramp.studio](http://ramp.studio)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you found a good model, you can submit it to [ramp.studio](http://www.ramp.studio). First, if it is your first time using RAMP, [sign up](http://www.ramp.studio/sign_up), otherwise [log in](http://www.ramp.studio/login). Then sign up for the 'FAN_revenue_prediction' challenge and the 'Saclay M2 Data Camp 2019/20' [event](https://ramp.studio/events/fan_revenue_prediction_saclay_datacamp_19). Both signups are controlled by RAMP administrators, so there **can be a delay between asking for signup and being able to submit**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your signup request is accepted, you can go to your [sandbox](https://ramp.studio/events/fan_revenue_prediction_saclay_datacamp_19/sandbox). Here you can either edit and save the code files on the left hand side of the page or upload your `feature_extractor.py` and `regressor.py` files on the right hand side of the page, then give your submission a name and click 'submit'. The submission is trained and tested on our backend in the same way as `ramp_test_submission` does it locally. While your submission is waiting in the queue and being trained, you can find it in the \"New submissions (pending training)\" table in [my submissions](https://ramp.studio/events/fan_revenue_prediction_saclay_datacamp_19/my_submissions). Once it is trained, you get an email, and your submission shows up on the [public leaderboard](https://ramp.studio/events/fan_revenue_prediction_saclay_datacamp_19/leaderboard). \n",
    "If there is an error (despite having tested your submission locally with `ramp_test_submission`), it will show up in the \"Failed submissions\" table in [my submissions](https://ramp.studio/events/fan_revenue_prediction_saclay_datacamp_19/my_submissions). You can click on the error to see part of the trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "After submission, do not forget to give credits to the previous submissions you reused or integrated into your submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set we use at the backend is usually different from what you find in the starting kit, so the score may be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "The usual way to work with RAMP is to explore solutions, add feature transformations, select models, perhaps do some AutoML/hyperopt, etc., _locally_ then check that your submission works locally with `ramp_test_submission`. The script will print mean cross-validation scores if your submission works.\n",
    "\n",
    "The official score in this RAMP (the first score column after \"historical contributivity\" on the [leaderboard](https://ramp.studio/events/fan_revenue_prediction_saclay_datacamp_19/leaderboard)) is `FAN error`."
